# Handwritten Character Recognition using MLP  

This project implements a **handwritten character recognition** system using **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** from Scikit-Learn. The model is trained on the **EMNIST dataset** and predicts characters from input images.  

## Features  
- Uses **MLPClassifier** from Scikit-Learn  
- Trained on EMNIST dataset  
- Achieves ~77% accuracy  
- Preprocessing includes grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization  

## Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UsmanAliAshraf/Handwriting-Detection-Model.git
   cd Handwriting-Detection-Model
